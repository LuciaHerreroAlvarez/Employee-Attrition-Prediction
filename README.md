# Employee Attrition Prediction
**Description:**  
A comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within a company, designed to predict the risk of attrition, quantify its economic impact, and aid decision-making. Using **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Business Analytics** techniques, this project aims to provide actionable solutions to the talent retention problem.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Quantify the attrition rate**: Analyze the extent of the problem.
- **Predict which employees are at risk of leaving**: Use a predictive model to identify employees with a high likelihood of attrition.
- **Measure the economic impact of attrition**: Estimate the company's losses due to employee turnover.
- **Strategic decision-making**: Provide tools for HR managers to take targeted actions.

## üìä Summary

### Conclusions:
- **Predictive model**: The **Decision Tree model** achieved an accuracy of **0.69**, allowing reasonable prediction of whether an employee is at risk of leaving.
- **Strategic impact**: The Tableau dashboard provides a **clear view** of the data and predictions, helping company decision-makers take quick action on critical cases.

### Challenges faced:
- **Data quality**: Encountered issues with incomplete and imbalanced data, requiring advanced cleaning techniques and handling of missing values.
- **Feature selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting attrition was key to improving the model's performance.

### Techniques applied:
- **Business Analytics**: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and generation of **insights** based on key questions.
- **Machine Learning**: Data preparation, model design, and training of a **Decision Tree** using **Scikit-Learn**.
- **Productionalization**: Development of an **interactive dashboard** in **Tableau** to visualize predictions and facilitate decision-making.

### Programs used:
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- **Tableau** for dashboard visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for data exploration and analysis.

### Future Work:
- **Improve the model**: Test other machine learning models such as Random Forest or XGBoost to enhance accuracy.
- **Real-time implementation**: Integrate real-time prediction into the company‚Äôs HR system.
- **Deeper analysis**: Conduct **sentiment analysis** on employee exit interviews.
